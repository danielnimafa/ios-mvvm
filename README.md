# My Learning Progress: MVVM Software Architectural Pattern Implementation
This project is based on Ray Wenderlich tutorial on youtube about MVVM Video. I'm very excited for having better understanding about this pattern. The codes insde controller is become cleaner. One of some cons of this pattern is overkill for simple app. My next learning journey is about to implement unit test on this project. The view controllers UI build by using programmatic approach by the way. Happy Coding! ?:)
